  <title>Subspaces</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
  Once we define a mathematical structure that we're interested in, it is common to look for sub-objects that inherit the 
  same structure. When we work with vector spaces, we are interested in smaller subsets that are themselves vector spaces under the 
  same addition and vector space operations. In this chapter we look at subspaces of <m>\R^n</m>, and then examine how we 
  can naturally associate a number of subspaces to a matrix.
