  <title>Dot Products and Projections</title>

  <introduction>

    <p>
So far, we have not introduced any way to take the product of two vectors. This will remain the case, although
in this chapter we introduce an operation called the dot product, which is a kind of product of two vectors
that results in a scalar. We define this purely algebraically, but then will see that this formula contains 
geometric information. We finish this chapter with an application of dot products to a very important notion 
called a projection.
