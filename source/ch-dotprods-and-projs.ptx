  <title>Dot Products and Projections</title>

  <introduction>

    <p>
So far, we have not introduced any way to take the product of two vectors. In this chapter, we introduce 
the dot product, which results in a scalar, and the cross product, which results in another vector but is 
only defined in <m>\R^3</m>. Applications of the dot product include calculating angles and projections, 
while the cross product can be used to measure the area of parallelograms and to find orthogonal vectors.
