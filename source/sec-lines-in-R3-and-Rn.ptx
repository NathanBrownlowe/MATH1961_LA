  <title>Lines in <m>\mathbb{R}^3</m> and <m>\mathbb{R}^n</m></title>

 <p>
In <m>\R^3</m>, the vector form and parametric equations for a line look very similar to in <m>\R^2</m>. 
The only difference is that we have 3 components now instead of 2. If you look closely, in the calculation 
where we derived the vector form of a line in <m>\R^2</m>, we only used general facts about vectors and 
about being parallel, and never used any properties specific to <m>\R^2</m>. Therefore that calculation 
works for <m>\R^3</m> as well.
</p>


<definition xml:id="def-vec-and-para-in-R3">
<statement>
<p>
Consider a line <m>\ell</m> in <m>\R^3</m> that passes through a point <m>P = (p_1, p_2, p_3)</m> and 
has direction vector <m>\vect{d} = [d_1, d_2, d_3]</m>. The <term>vector form</term> of the equation 
for <m>\ell</m> is <me>
\vect{x} = \vect{p} + t\vect{d}, \qquad t\in \R,
</me>
where <m>\vect{p} = \overrightarrow{OP} = [p_1, p_2, p_3]</m> and 
<m>\vect{x} = \overrightarrow{OX} = [x, y, z]</m>, and the <term>parametric equations</term> 
for <m>\ell</m> are
<me>
\left\{
\begin{aligned}
  x \amp  = p_1+ d_1t \\
  y \amp  = p_2 +d_2t \\
  z \amp  = p_3 + d_3t

<example xml:id="ex-vec-form-in-R3">
<statement>
<p>
Find the vector form for the line that passes through the points <m>A = (1, 1, 3)</m> and <m>B = (2, 1, 5)</m>. 
We take <m>\vect{p} = \overrightarrow{OA} = [1, 1, 3]</m> and 
<m>\vect{d} = \overrightarrow{AB} = [2, 1, 5] - [1, 1, 3] = [1, 0, 2]</m>, 
so the vector form is
  <me>
  [x, y,z] = [1, 1, 3] + t[1, 0, 2], \qquad t\in \R.

<remark xml:id="rem-no-gen-form-in-R3">
<p>
Lines in <m>\R^3</m> do not have normal forms or general forms. We will see in the next section 
that in <m>\R^3</m>, a normal vector and a point describe a plane instead.
</p>
</remark>

<p>
We can generalise vector forms and parametric equations to lines in <m>\R^n</m>.
</p>


<example xml:id="ex-para-eqs-in-R3">
<statement>
<p>
The equation
<me>
\vect{x} = [1, 0, 2, 3] + t[2, 3, -1, 0], \qquad t\in \R
</me>
is the vector form of a line in <m>\R^4</m>. It has parametric equations
<me>
\left\{
\begin{aligned}
  x_1 \amp  = 1+ 2t \\
  x_2 \amp  = 3t    \\
  x_3 \amp  = 2-t   \\
  x_4 \amp  = 3

<p>
In <m>\R^2</m>, the are only 3 possibilities for how lines intersect: they either coincide (are the same line), 
intersect at a single point, or are parallel without intersecting, as shown in <xref ref="fig-R2_int"/>. 
In <m>\R^3</m>, there is another possibility, which is called being skew.

<definition xml:id="def-skew-lines">
<statement>
<p>Two lines in <m>\R^n</m> are called <term>skew</term> if they do not intersect and are not 
parallel.

  <example xml:id="ex-not-skew">
<statement>
<p>
Show that the lines with the following vector forms are not skew:
<md>
<mrow>
\ell_1: \amp  \qquad \vect{x} = s[1, 1, 1], \qquad s\in \R  \\
\ell_2: \amp  \qquad \vect{x} = t[1, 2, 3], \qquad t\in \R
</mrow>
</md>.
Substituting <m>s = 0</m> into the vector form for <m>\ell_1</m> gives <m>\vect{x} = [0, 0, 0]</m>. 
Substituting <m>t = 0</m> into the vector form for <m>\ell_2</m> gives <m>\vect{x} = [0, 0, 0]</m>. 
Therefore the lines intersect at <m>(0, 0, 0)</m>, so they are not skew.
</p>
</statement>
</example>

<example xml:id="ex-determining-skew">
<statement>
<p>
Determine whether the lines with the following vector forms are skew
<md>
<mrow>
\ell_1: \amp  \qquad \vect{x} = [1, 0, -2] + s[1, 1, 1], \qquad s\in \R   \\
\ell_2: \amp  \qquad \vect{x} = [1, 2, 3] + t[1, -1, -2], \qquad t\in \R
</mrow>
</md>.
The lines are not parallel since the direction vectors <m>\vect{d}_1 = [1, 1, 1]</m> and 
<m>\vect{d}_2 = [1, -1, 2]</m> are not parallel. To determine whether the lines intersect, we 
try to equate their parametric equations:
<me>
\begin{cases}
  1+s    = 1+ t \\
  s      = 2-t  \\
  -2+s   = 3-2t 
\end{cases}
</me>
which rearranges to give
<me>
\begin{cases}
  s-t  = 0 \\
  s+t  = 2 \\
  s+2t = 5
\end{cases}
</me>.
Solving the first two equations gives <m>s = t=1</m>, but substituting this into the third equation 
gives <m>s + 2t = 3 \ne 5</m>. Therefore this system of equations has no solutions, so the lines do 
not intersect. Therefore <m>\ell_1</m> and <m>\ell_2</m> are skew.
