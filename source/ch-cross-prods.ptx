  <title>Cross Products</title>

  <introduction>
    <p> 
      In this chapter a new operation on vectors. This operation, called the cross product, does take two vectors
      and outputs a vector (unlike the dot product), but it is only defined in <m>\R^3</m>. (Well, it is also
      defined in <m>\R^7</m>, but we will leave the very technical reasons why this is the case for the interested reader.) The cross product 
    is a nice operation in the sense that it does, again, encode geometric information about vectors. But it also 
  has some less desirable qualities, such as a lack of associativity.
