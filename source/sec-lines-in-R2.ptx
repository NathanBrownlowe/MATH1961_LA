<statement>
<p>
Let <m>\ell</m> be a line in <m>\R^2</m>. A <term>normal vector</term> for <m>\ell</m> is a nonzero 
vector <m>\vect{n}</m> which is orthogonal to <m>\ell</m>.
</p>
</statement>
</definition>

<p>
A normal vector <m>\vect{n}</m> and one point <m>P</m> on <m>\ell</m> is enough to completely determine the 
line <m>\ell</m>, which we will show by writing the equation for <m>\ell</m> in terms of these two objects. 
Notice that unlike for vectors, the position of <m>\ell</m> in space matters, which is why we need a point 
<m>P</m>.
</p>

<p>Fix <m>P \in \ell</m>, and let <m>X = (x, y)</m> be any point. Let 
<m>\vect{x} = \overrightarrow{OX} = [x, y]</m> and <m>\vect{p} = \overrightarrow{OP}</m>, as shown 
in <xref ref="fig-normal"/>.

We have
<md>
<mrow>
X \in \ell \amp  \iff \overrightarrow{PX} \text{ is parallel to } \ell       \\
\amp  \iff \overrightarrow{PX} \text{ is orthogonal to } \vect{n} \\
\amp  \iff \overrightarrow{PX} \cdot \vect{n} = 0
</mrow>
</md>
(The symbol <m>\iff</m> stands for `if and only if'.) We also have <m>\overrightarrow{PX} = \overrightarrow{OX} - \overrightarrow{OP}</m>, so
<md>
<mrow>
X \in \ell \amp  \iff (\vect{x} - \vect{p}) \cdot \vect{n} = 0          \\
\amp  \iff \vect{x} \cdot \vect{n} = \vect{p}\cdot \vect{n}
</mrow>
</md>.
This means that <m>\vect{x} \cdot \vect{n} = \vect{p}\cdot \vect{n}</m> is an equation for <m>\ell</m>. 
The next definition summarises this calculation and gives the equation a name.
</p>

<definition xml:id="def-normal-form">

or equivalently

<p>
You may be more familiar from high school with equations for lines looking like <m>y = mx +b</m> or 
<m>ax + by = c</m>. We can rearrange the normal form to look like this. Suppose <m>\vect{n} = [a, b]</m> 
and <m>P = (p_1, p_2)</m>, so <m>\vect{p} =[p_1, p_2]</m>. Then 
<m>\vect{n}\cdot \vect{x} = \vect{n}\cdot \vect{p}</m> becomes
  <me>
  [a, b] \cdot [x, y] = [a, b]\cdot [p_1, p_2],
</me>
which is <m>ax + by = ap_1 +bp_2</m>, or <m>ax + by = c</m> where 
<m>c = \vect{n}\cdot \vect{p} = ap_1 + bp_2</m>.

<p>
The line with general equation <m>3x- y = 9</m> has a normal vector <m>[3, -1]</m>, by looking at its 
coefficients. Any nonzero scalar multiple of <m>[3, -1]</m> would also be a normal vector to the line.

Find the normal and general forms of the equation of a line through <m>(2, -1)</m> and perpendicular to

<m>\vect{p} =[2, -1]</m>. We have
<me>
\vect{n}\cdot \vect{p} = [3, 4]\cdot [2, -1] = 6 - 4 = 2,

so the normal form is <m>[3, 4] \cdot [x, y] = [3, 4] \cdot [2, -1]</m>, which simplifies to
  <me>
  [3, 4]\cdot [x, y] = 2

Notice that if we had picked a different normal vector and a different point on the same line, the normal 
and general forms would look different, although they would still describe the same line.

<p>
We will now present a different approach to finding an equation for a line in <m>\R^2</m>. 
It still involves a point and a direction. The difference is that now we will use a vector parallel to the 
line, instead of a vector normal to the line.
</p>

<definition xml:id="def-direction-vector">
<statement>
<p>
A <term>direction vector</term> for a line <m>\ell</m> in <m>\R^2</m> is a nonzero vector

<p>
Given a direction vector <m>\vect{d}</m> for a line <m>\ell</m> and a point <m>P\in \ell</m> with 
position vector <m>\vect{p}</m>, we can write down an equation for <m>\ell</m>. Let <m>X</m> be any point 
with position vector <m>\vect{x}</m>. Then
<md>
<mrow>
X \in \ell \amp  \iff \overrightarrow{PX} \text{ is parallel to } \vect{d} \\

for some <m>t\in \R</m>. We have <m>\overrightarrow{PX} = \vect{x} - \vect{p}</m>, so
<me>
X \in \ell \iff \vect{x} - \vect{p} = t\vect{d} \iff \vect{x} = \vect{p} + t\vect{d}

This is summarised in the next definition.</p>

The fourth and final form of the equation of a line in <m>\R^2</m> comes from expanding the vector 
form into its components. Suppose <m>\vect{d} = [d_1, d_2]</m>, <m>\vect{p} = [p_1, p_2]</m>, and

<term>Summary:</term> A line <m>\ell</m> in <m>\R^2</m> is described by a point and a direction. If we use a 
normal vector to <m>\ell</m>, then the equation is called a normal form when written using vectors, and 
general form when written in components. If we use a direction vector instead, the equation is called a 
vector form when written using vectors, and when written in components we call them parametric equations.

<p>
To finish this section, we give a few examples and final comments. To find a direction vector 
<m>\vect{d}</m> for a line <m>\ell</m>, find two points <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> on <m>\ell</m>. Then 
<m>\vect{d} = \overrightarrow{AB}</m> is a direction vector for <m>\ell</m>. This is illustrated 
in <xref ref="fig-finding_d"/>.

Find the vector form and parametric equations for the line <m>\ell</m> through the points

<p>
Since a normal vector <m>\vect{n}</m> for a line <m>\ell</m> in <m>\R^2</m> is orthogonal, while a 
direction vector <m>\vect{d}</m> is parallel, this means
<me>
\vect{n}\cdot \vect{d} = 0
</me>.
This observation can help us find <m>\vect{d}</m> if we know <m>\vect{n}</m>, or to find 
<m>\vect{n}</m> if we know <m>\vect{d}</m>. This is shown in the next two examples.

A normal vector is <m>\vect{n} = [1, 2]</m>. Let <m>\vect{d} = [d_1, d_2]</m>. We must have

\vect{n}\cdot \vect{d} = d_1 + 2d_2 = 0,

A direction vector is <m>\vect{d} = [2, 3]</m>, so <m>\vect{n} = [-3, 2]</m> is a normal vector,
