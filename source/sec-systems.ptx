  <title>Systems of linear equations</title>

 <p>
A general equation for a line in <m>\R^2</m> is <m>ax+by = c</m>, and a general equation for 
a plane in <m>\R^3</m> is <m>ax+by+cz = d</m>. These are examples of what we call linear 
equations.
</p>

<definition xml:id="def-linear-equation">
<statement>
<p>
A <term>linear equation</term> in <m>n</m> variables <m>x_1</m>, <m>x_2, \dots, x_n</m> is 
an equation of the form
<me>
a_1x_1 + a_2x_2 + \dots + a_nx_n = b
</me>
for constants <m>a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n, b \in \R</m>. A <term>solution</term> to this 
equation is a collection of real numbers <m>x_1 = s_1</m>, <m>x_2 = s_2, \dots, x_n = s_n</m> 
such that
<me>
a_1s_1 + a_2s_2 + \dots + a_ns_n = b
</me>.
</p>
</statement>
</definition>

<p>
The word <em>linear</em> means that we can only add and scale the variables 
<m>x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n</m> (so no multiplication, division, powers, trigonometric 
functions, etc.).
</p>

<example xml:id="ex-linear-non-linear">
<statement>
<p>
The equations <m>3x+4y=2</m> and <m>2x+6y+z=0</m> are both linear. 
The equation <m>x_1x_2 = 3</m> is not linear because it involves multiplying variables. 
The equation for a circle <m>x_1^2 + x_2^2 = r</m> is nonlinear because it involves powers. 
Trigonometric equations like <m>\cos\theta = 1</m> are nonlinear.
</p>
</statement>
</example>

<example xml:id="ex-finding-sols">
<statement>
<p>Find two solutions for the linear equation <m>2x - 3y = 1</m>.
</p>
<p>
Rearranging gives <m>x = \frac{1}{2}(1+3y)</m>. Choosing <m>y = 0</m> gives the solution 
<m>x = \frac{1}{2}, y=0</m>, and choosing <m>y = 1</m> gives the solution <m>x = 2, y=1</m>. 
Notice that there are infinitely many solutions, because we could have chosen any value 
for <m>y</m>.
</p>
</statement>
</example>

<p>
In this chapter we study systems of linear equations, which is what happens when we have 
multiple linear equations at once.
</p>

<definition xml:id="def-systems">
<statement>
<p>
A <term>system of linear equations</term> in <m>n</m> variables <m>x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n</m> is
<md>
<mrow>
a_{11}x_1 + a_{12}x_2 + \amp  \dots + a_{1n}x_n = b_1  \\
a_{21}x_1 + a_{22}x_2 + \amp  \dots + a_{2n}x_n = b_2  \\
\vdots                  \amp                           \\
a_{m1}x_1 + a_{m2}x_2 + \amp  \dots + a_{mn}x_n = b_m
</mrow>
</md>,
where <m>a_{ij}, b_i \in \R</m> for <m>1 \le i \le m</m>, <m>1\le j\le n</m>, and <m>i, j \in \N</m>. 
The system is <term>homogeneous</term> if <m>b_i = 0</m> for all <m>i = 1, 2, \dots, m</m>. 
A <term>solution</term> to the system is a collection of real numbers 
<m>x_1 = s_1, x_2 = s_2, \dots, x_n = s_n</m> that simultaneously satisfy all the equations, 
i.e.\ such that
<me>
a_{i1}s_1 + a_{i2}s_2 + \dots + a_{in}s_n = b_i
</me>
for all <m>i \in \N</m> such that <m>1\le i\le m</m>.
</p>
</statement>
</definition>

<p>
We can solve these equations by scaling equations and adding or subtracting them, which is 
called `elimination'.
</p>

<example xml:id="ex-pt">
<statement>
<p>
Solve the system
<me>
\begin{cases}
  2x+y = 2 \\
  x - y = 1
\end{cases}
</me>.
</p>

<p>
Adding the equations gives <m>3x = 3</m>, so <m>x= 1</m>. Back-substituting this into the first 
equation gives <m>y = 2 - 2x = 0</m>.
</p>
</statement>
</example>

<example xml:id="ex-parallel">
<statement>
<p>
Solve the system
<me>
\begin{cases}
  2x+y = 2 \\
  2x + y = 0
\end{cases}
</me>.
</p>
<p>
Subtracting the equations gives <m>0 = 2</m>, which is impossible. Therefore there are no solutions.
</p>
</statement>
</example>

<example xml:id="ex-coincide">
<statement>
<p>
Solve the system
<me>
\begin{cases}
  2x+y = 2 \\
  4x + 2y = 4
\end{cases}
</me>.
</p>
<p>
If we try to subtract 2 times the first equation from the second, we get <m>0 = 0</m>, which is 
true but not helpful. Instead, to solve this, let <m>y = t</m> where <m>t\in \R</m> is a parameter. 
Then, <m>x = \frac{1}{2}(2-t)</m>, <m>y=t</m> is a solution for any <m>t\in \R</m>.
</p>
</statement>
</example>

<p>
Geometrically, <xref ref="ex-pt"/> has a unique solution because it corresponds to the intersection 
of non-parallel lines. <xref ref="ex-parallel"/> has no solution because it corresponds to parallel 
(non-coinciding) lines. <xref ref="ex-coincide"/> has infinite solutions given by the 
line <m>2x + y = 2</m>, which has parametric equations
<me>
x = \frac{1}{2}(2-t), y=t, \qquad t\in \R
</me>.
These examples show that we can handle a system of two equations in two variables, but we want to 
introduce a method for solving linear equations which gives us a procedure to solve systems of any 
size. To do this, it will help to have the following definition.
</p>

<definition xml:id="def-matrix">
<statement>
<p>A <term>matrix</term> is a rectangular array of real numbers.
</p>
</statement>
</definition>

<p>
For example, the following are all matrices:
<me>
\begin{bmatrix}
  1 \amp  2 \\
  3 \amp  4 \\
\end{bmatrix}
,\quad \begin{bmatrix}1 \\ -1\end{bmatrix},\quad
\begin{bmatrix}
  1   \amp  0  \amp  1/2 \\
  2   \amp  -3 \amp  1   \\
  4/5 \amp  6  \amp  -7
\end{bmatrix}
,\quad [-8]
</me>.
We will have much more to say about matrices during the rest of the course, where their 
significance will become more clear. For now, for solving systems of linear equations, 
we will focus on a special kind of matrix.
</p>



<definition xml:id="def-augmented-matrix">
<statement>
<p>

a_{11}x_1 + a_{12}x_2 + \amp  \dots + a_{1n}x_n = b_1 \\

\left[\begin{array}{cccc|c}
  a_{11} \amp  a_{12} \amp  \cdots \amp a_{1n} \amp  b_1\\
  a_{21} \amp  a_{22} \amp  \cdots \amp a_{2n} \amp  b_2\\

  a_{m1} \amp  a_{m2} \amp  \cdots \amp  a_{mn} \amp  b_m
\end{array}\right]
</me>.
</p>
</statement>
</definition>

<p>
The following example shows how to use augmented matrix notation when solving a system of 
linear equations.
</p>


<example xml:id="ex-lineq">
<statement>
<p>
Solve the following system of linear equations with an augmented matrix:
<me>
\left\{
\begin{aligned}
  x - y - z    \amp  = 2  \\
  3x - 3y + 2z \amp  = 16 \\
  2x - y + z   \amp  = 9
\end{aligned}
\right.
</me>.
The corresponding augmented matrix collects all the coefficients
<me>
\begin{amatrix}{ccc}
  1 \amp  -1 \amp  -1 \amp  2\\
  3 \amp  -3 \amp  2 \amp  16\\
  2 \amp  -1 \amp  1 \amp  9
\end{amatrix}

</me>
To eliminate, from row two, subtract <m>3 \times \text{row 1}</m>, and from row three, 
subtract <m>2\times \text{row 1}</m>. This gives
<me>
\begin{amatrix}{ccc}
  1 \amp  -1 \amp  -1 \amp  2\\
  0 \amp  0 \amp  5 \amp  10\\
  0 \amp  1 \amp  3 \amp  5
\end{amatrix}
,
</me>
and swapping the second and third row gives
<me>
\begin{amatrix}{ccc}
  1 \amp  -1 \amp  -1 \amp  2\\
  0 \amp  1 \amp  3 \amp  5\\
  0 \amp  0 \amp  5 \amp  10
\end{amatrix}
</me>.
We can now solve the system by `back-substituting', which means solving the augmented matrix 
from the bottom upwards. The last row of the matrix says that <m>5z = 10</m>, so <m>z = 2</m>. 
The second row says that <m>y + 3z = 5</m>, so <m>y = 5 - 3z = -1</m>, and the first row 
says that <m>x = 2 + y + z = 2 - 1 + 2 = 3</m>.
</p>
</statement>
