  <title>Properties of determinants</title>

<p>
The following definition gives a name to matrices like <xref ref="ex-triangular"/> whose nonzero entries 
form a triangular shape.
</p>


<definition xml:id="def-triangular-matrix">
<statement>
<p>
An <m>n\times n</m> matrix <m>A = [a_{ij}]</m> is <term>upper triangular</term> if all entries below 
the diagonal are zero (so <m>a_{ij} = 0</m> for <m>i \gt  j</m>), <term>lower triangular</term> if 
all entries above the diagonal are zero (so <m>a_{ij} = 0</m> for <m>i \lt  j</m>), and 
<term>triangular</term> if it is either upper triangular or lower triangular.
</p>
</statement>
</definition>

<p>
The matrix in <xref ref="ex-triangular"/> is upper triangular. Notice that its determinant is the 
product of its diagonal entries. <em>>This is true for any triangular matrix</em>, which can be 
shown by expanding along the row or column which is zero apart from (possibly) one entry.
</p>

<example xml:id="ex-det-for-tri-matrices">
<statement>
<p>
Find the determinant of the matrices
<me>
A =
\begin{bmatrix}
  -1 \amp  0 \amp  4  \\
  0  \amp  2 \amp  -1 \\
  0  \amp  0 \amp  3
\end{bmatrix}
, \qquad B =
\begin{bmatrix}
  2  \amp  0 \amp  0 \\
  -1 \amp  0 \amp  0 \\
  5  \amp  3 \amp  -4
\end{bmatrix}
</me>.
</p>
<p>
These are triangular, so <m>\det(A) = (-1) \times 2 \times 3 = -6</m>, and 
<m>\det(B) = 2\times 0 \times (-4) = 0</m>.
</p>
</statement>
</example>

<p>
If a matrix has a row or column that is completely zero, we can expand along it to see that the determinant 
is zero.
</p>

<p>
The next theorem states how determinants interact with elementary row or 
column operations.
</p>


<theorem xml:id="thm-EROdet">
<statement>
<p>Let <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> be <m>n\times n</m> matrices.
<ol>
<li>
<p>If <m>B</m> is obtained from <m>A</m> by swapping two rows or columns, then
<me>
\det(B) = -\det(A)
</me>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If <m>B</m> is obtained from <m>A</m> by scaling one row or column by <m>c \in \R</m>, then
<me>
\det(B) = c\det(A)
</me>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If <m>B</m> is obtained from <m>A</m> by adding a multiple of one row or column to another, then <me>
\det(B) = \det(A)
</me>.
</p>
</li>
</ol></p>
</statement>
</theorem>

<corollary xml:id="cor-EROdet">
<statement>
<p>
If <m>B</m> is obtained from <m>A</m> by applying a sequence of elementary row operations, 
then <m>\det(B) = k\det(A)</m> for some nonzero <m>k\in \R</m>.
</p>
</statement>

<proof>
<p>
First assume that <m>B</m> is obtained from <m>A</m> by applying a single ERO. From 
<xref ref="thm-EROdet"/>, <m>\det(B) = k\det(A)</m> where <m>k = 1, -1</m> or <m>c</m>. Note that 
<m>c</m> must be nonzero since scaling by zero is not an ERO. Thus <m>k \ne 0</m>. This proves 
the corollary in this case.
</p>

<p>
To prove the full corollary, we can repeatedly apply the version of it proved in the previous 
paragraph: <m>k</m> will be a product of nonzero numbers and hence nonzero.
</p>
</proof>
</corollary>

<p>
The theorem allows us to row reduce the matrix to a simpler one with more zeroes.
</p>


<example xml:id="ex-dets-through-EROs">
<statement>
<p>
Find the determinant of the matrix
<me>
A =
\begin{bmatrix}
  2 \amp  5 \amp  7 \\
  1 \amp  4 \amp  5 \\
  3 \amp  6 \amp  12
\end{bmatrix}
</me>.
</p>
<p>
Performing EROs on <m>A</m>, we get
<md>
<mrow>
A =
\begin{bmatrix}
  2 \amp  5 \amp  7 \\
  1 \amp  4 \amp  5 \\
  3 \amp  6 \amp  12

\amp\xrightarrow{R_1 \leftrightarrow R_2}                        
\begin{bmatrix}
  1 \amp  4 \amp  5 \\
  2 \amp  5 \amp  7 \\
  3 \amp  6 \amp  12
\end{bmatrix}
\\
\amp\xrightarrow[R_3 \mapsto R_3 - 3R_1]{R_2 \mapsto R_2 - 2R_1} 
\begin{bmatrix}
  1 \amp  4  \amp  5  \\
  0 \amp  -3 \amp  -3 \\
  0 \amp  -6 \amp  -3
\end{bmatrix}
= B
</mrow>
</md>.
We have <m>\det(B) = -\det(A)</m> by <xref ref="thm-EROdet"/>, due to the row swap 
(the other operations did not affect the determinant). Thus
<me>
\det(A) = -\det(B) = -
\begin{vmatrix}
  1 \amp  4  \amp  5  \\
  0 \amp  -3 \amp  -3 \\
  0 \amp  -6 \amp  -3
\end{vmatrix}
= -1
\begin{vmatrix}
  -3 \amp  -3 \\ -6 \amp  -3
\end{vmatrix}
=  9.

<theorem xml:id="thm-det">
<statement>
<p>
Let <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> be <m>n\times n</m> matrices, and let <m>c\in \R</m>. Then
<ol>
<li>
<p><m>\det(I_n) = 1</m>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><m>\det(cA) = c^n \det(A)</m>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><m>\det(AB) = \det(A)\det(B)</m>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If <m>A</m> is invertible, then <m>\det(A) \ne 0</m> and <m>\det(A\inv) = \frac{1}{ \det(A) }</m>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><m>\det(A^T) = \det(A)</m>
</p>
</li>
</ol></p>
</statement>

<proof>
<p>
Property 1 holds because <m>I_n</m> is a triangular matrix with all diagonal entries equal to <m>1</m>, 
so <m>\det(I_n) = 1 \times 1 \times \cdots \times 1 = 1</m>.
</p>

<p>
Property 2 follows from <xref ref="thm-EROdet"/>, since <m>cA</m> is obtained from <m>A</m> by performing 
the sequence of <m>n</m> EROs
<me>
R_1 \mapsto cR_1, R_2 \mapsto cR_2, \dots, R_n \mapsto cR_n,
</me>
each of which multiply the determinant by <m>c</m>.
</p>
<p>We will not prove Property 3; it is beyond the scope of this course. However, if you are interested, 
this is proved as Theorem 4.7 of Poole's textbook.
</p>

<p>
For Property 4, suppose that <m>A</m> is invertible. Then by Properties 1 and 3,
<me>
\det(A)\det(A\inv) = \det(AA\inv) = \det(I_n) = 1,
</me>
which means that <m>\det(A) \ne 0</m> and <m>\det(A\inv) = 1/\det(A)</m>.
</p>

<p>
Finally, Property 5 holds because expanding along the <m>i</m>th row of <m>A^T</m> gives the 
same number as expanding along the <m>i</m>th column of <m>A</m>.
</p>
</proof>
</theorem>

<example xml:id="ex-det-and-matrix-algebra">
<statement>
<p>Let <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> be invertible <m>3\times 3</m> matrices such that <m>\det(A) = 2</m> and 
<m>\det(B) = 5</m>. Then
<md>
<mrow>
\det(2A\inv B^T) \amp  = 2^3 \det(A\inv B^T) = 2^3\det(A\inv)\det(B^T)               \\
\amp  = 2^3\frac{1}{\det(A)}\det(B) = 2^3\times \frac{1}{2}\times 5 \\
\amp  = 20.
</mrow>
</md>
</p>
</statement>
</example>

<p>
Remember that the reason we introduced the determinant was because we wanted a number which 
tells us whether a matrix is invertible. We can now show that this is precisely what the 
determinant does.
</p>

<theorem xml:id="thm-invdet">
<statement>
<p>
An <m>n\times n</m> matrix <m>A</m> is invertible if and only if <m>\det(A) \ne 0</m>.
</p>
</statement>

<proof>
<p>
Consider the augmented matrix <m>
\begin{amatrix}{c} A \amp  I
\end{amatrix}
</m> and its RREF <m>
\begin{amatrix}{c} R \amp  B
\end{amatrix}
</m>. If <m>A</m> is invertible, then there is a sequence of EROs that reduces <m>A</m> to <m>I</m>, 
so by applying <xref ref="cor-EROdet"/>, there is a constant <m>k\in\R\setminus\{0\}</m> such that
<me>
1 = \det(I) = k\det(A),
</me>
so <m>\det(A) \ne 0</m>. (Alternatively, we already showed this in <xref ref="thm-det"/>.)
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, if <m>A</m> is not invertible, then <m>R</m> must have a row of zeroes, 
so <m>\det(R) = 0</m>. Again applying <xref ref="cor-EROdet"/>, there is a nonzero constant 
<m>k</m> such that
<me>
0 = \det(R)= k\det(A)
</me>.
This shows that <m>\det(A) = 0.</m>
</p>
</proof>
</theorem>
