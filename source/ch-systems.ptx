  <title>Systems of Linear Equations</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
There are many practical situations where it's useful to be able to solve a system of 
linear equations. It's also useful for geometric problems: in the previous chapters, we have 
already seen that systems of linear equations can appear in problems about linear combinations, 
intersections of lines or planes, and skew lines. You may have already seen how to solve 
these equations in high school, but in this chapter we will present a different method. It 
has the advantage of being a routine which always works, and which can be done fairly quickly 
with practice. This method also introduces the notion of an augmented matrix, which will lead 
into our study of matrices for the rest of the course.
