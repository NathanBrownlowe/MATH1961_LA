  <title>Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors</title>

  <introduction>
   <p>
Every matrix <m>A</m> has at least one special vector <m>\vect{x}</m> such that <m>A\vect{x}</m> 
is a scalar multiple of <m>\vect{x}</m>. These vectors are called eigenvectors, where the German prefix 
`eigen' meaning `characteristic' or `own' emphasizes how the vector <m>\vect{x}</m> is closely related 
to the matrix <m>A</m>. In this chapter, we introduce eigenvectors and show how to calculate them. 
There will be applications of eigenvectors in the next chapter and <xref ref="ch-markov-chains"/>.
