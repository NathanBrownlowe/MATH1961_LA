  <title>Vectors</title>

  <introduction>
    <p> Vectors are mathematical objects characterised by their magnitude (also called length) and direction. 
      Especially for applications to physics or engineering, we can think of vectors as measurable quantities 
      that have a direction: for example, displacement, velocity, and force are vectors, while distance, speed, 
      and mass are not. In this chapter we define vectors and introduce their main properties. </p>
