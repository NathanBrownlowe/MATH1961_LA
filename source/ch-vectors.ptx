  <title>Vectors</title>

  <introduction>
    <p> Vectors are mathematical objects characterised by their magnitude (also called length) and direction. 
      In applications such as physics and engineering, we think of vectors as measurable quantities 
      that have a direction: for example, displacement, velocity, and force are vectors, while distance, speed, 
      and mass are not. In this chapter we define vectors and introduce their main properties. We start with
      a focus on vectors in the plane <m>\R^2</m>, before moving to the more general <m>\R^n</m>, and 
      finishing with an abstraction to vector spaces over the real numbers.
