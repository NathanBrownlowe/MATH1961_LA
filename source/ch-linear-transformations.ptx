  <title>Linear transformations</title>

  <introduction>
   <p>
    We have studied the structure of vector spaces extensively. It is now time to study the functions between vector spaces
    that we care about in linear algebra; namely, the functions that preserve the vector space structure. These functions are callled
    <em>linear transformations</em>. (Note that 'transformation' is just a fancy word for function.) In this chapter we introduce the notion
    of a linear transformation, and the main result says these functions are nothing but matrices.
